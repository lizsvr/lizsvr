👋 Hey, I’m Lizsvr
🔧 On a journey to become a real-world developer.
I’m currently learning and building with Node.js, and React. My goal is to turn ideas into working apps — one line of code at a time.

💡 I believe: “The best way to learn is by doing.”
From setting up APIs and crafting UIs to fixing annoying bugs — it’s all part of the process I enjoy.

📌 What I’m currently focused on:

🔹 Building small full-stack projects

🔹 Learning React with Tailwind CSS

🔹 Experimenting with simple Android apps

✨ Motto: “Make it real, make it work.”
